- 👋 Hi, I’m @samvatsan
- 👀 I’m interested in a *lot* of things, especially the various applications of machine learning and mathematical modeling. My repos focus on content from such projects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about reinforcement learning and species distribution modeling. I'm using the former at my internship at the Air Force Research Lab (<https://www.act3-ace.com/about>), and the latter as a research assistant at the Irish Basking Shark Group (<https://www.baskingshark.ie/>). 
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate at the moment, but I may soon begin return to a project to classify and predict water quality using ANNs. I'd love to work with someone on that!
- 📫 If you'd like to learn more about what I'm working on or chat about shared interests, feel free to email me at samvatsan@gmail.com.
